# PlanMyTrip App Upgradation<br/>
## Background <br/>
Beta testers love PlanMyTrip app. And, as with any new product, they’ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data we’ve already retrieved in this module. Then, we'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.<br/>
## What We Are Creating<br/>
We will submit the following deliverables:<br/>
Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data<br/>
![DataFrame of Cities](https://github.com/ramyasnl/World_weather_analysis_challenge/blob/main/Deliverable1/allcitiesdataframe.png)<br/>
Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map<br/>
![All Cities Marked](https://github.com/ramyasnl/World_weather_analysis_challenge/blob/main/Deliverable2/allcities2.png)<br/>
Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map<br/>
![Route Map Connecting All the Travel Destinations ](https://github.com/ramyasnl/World_weather_analysis_challenge/blob/main/Deliverable3/WeatherPy_travel_map.png)<br/>
![Added Weather Description To The Route](https://github.com/ramyasnl/World_weather_analysis_challenge/blob/main/Deliverable3/WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png.png) <br/>


### Note for me <br/>
We worked in anaconda prompt python 3 environment <br/>
Before going into jupyternotebook , "conda install numpy" should be done ,dont forget to follow the instructions in googleapi.txt in desktop <br/>
Every API needs a key , Here we have used allweather.com for generating the dataframe of cities , the api key is in config.py in the system .<br/>
For Deliverable 2 ,3 we use googleApi to create the maps and we need to enable Directions API in google api to create the Deliverable 3,<br/>
googlekey is also in the system .<br/>
