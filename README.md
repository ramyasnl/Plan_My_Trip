# World_weather_analysis_submission<br/>
We worked in anaconda prompt python 3 environment <br/>
Before going into jupyternotebook , "conda install numpy" should be done  is dont forget to follow the instructions in googleapi.txt in desktop <br/>
Every API needs a key , Here we have used allweather.com for generating the dataframe of cities , the api key is in config.py in the system .<br/>
For Deliverable 2 ,3 we use googleApi to create the maps and we need to enable Directions API in google api to create the Deliverable 3,<br/>
googlekey is also in the system .<br/>
